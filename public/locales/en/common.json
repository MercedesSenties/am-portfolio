  "about.description": "I'm a highly motivated and adaptable programmer and Technical Digital Marketing Specialist from Mexico, fluent in English, Spanish, and Italian. With over a year of experience across both tech consulting and development companies, plus three more years of freelance experience, I’ve worked on creating websites, online stores, and apps using frameworks like Ionic and Gatsby, platforms like Wordpress and Shopify, as well as libraries like React. Additionally, I manage the technical setup for digital marketing campaigns, ensuring crucial events—such as eCommerce funnel tracking—are accurately implemented. My background includes formal studies in Programming and Communications. Outside of work, I enjoy singing, volunteering, and taking long walks with my dog, Ofelia. Driven by curiosity and a commitment to growth, I'm always seeking opportunities to learn more about new technologies and development practices.",
